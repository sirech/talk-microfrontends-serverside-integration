this a topic very relevant for us in our projects

???

- want to answer this 3 questions
- what is a microfrontend
- why would you use it
- how can you get started

- goal: walk away with an understanding of the pros and cons of the approach, and tips to get started

## Everybody got into the microservices train

???

- everybody seems to be using microservices these days

---

class: center middle

## Whether they actually needed or not 

---

class: center middle

## What about the frontend, though?

---

class: center middle

![frontend-monolith](images/frontend-monolith.png)

???

- You went through all the trouble of adopting microservices, defining boundaries
- Now the frontend remains a monolotih that is hard to deploy

## Release frequency
### Backend: .green[Daily]
### Frontend: .bad-practice[Quarterly]
]

???

- This seems extreme, but it is in fact a setup that we have observed in some of our projects

> We've seen significant benefits from introducing microservices, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create a front-end monolith — a large, entangled browser application that sits on top of the back-end services — largely neutralizing the benefits of microservices. 

--

<hr />

> Micro frontends have continued to gain in popularity since they were first introduced. We've seen many teams adopt some form of this architecture as a way to manage the complexity of multiple developers and teams contributing to the same user experience.

# What are microfrontends?

---

class: center middle

## An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole

---

class: center middle

## From the developers perspective

---

class: center middle

![microfrontends](images/microfrontends.png)

.bottom-right[
microfrontends.com
]

???

- the frontend is now a collection of different apps
- Before being delivered to the end user, it is composed in *some way*
- We'll talk about different ways later

---

class: center middle

## From the users perspective

---

class: center middle

![sample-app](images/sample-app.png)

.bottom-right[
microfrontends.com
]

???

- The user should not realize the page is composed by microfrontends

---

class: center middle

### martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html

???

- There is an article from a colleague from us which goes into a lot of detail

---

class: transition

# Why use them?

---

class: center middle

## Incremental updates

???

- no big bang releases

---

class: center middle

## Independent deployments

???

- path to production

---

class: center middle

## Autonomous teams

???

- vertical slicing instead of horizontal slicing

---

class: transition
# Should you use microfrontends?

---

class: center middle

## Not everybody is sold

---

class: center middle

![abramov](images/abramov.png)

???

- when the article on Martin Fowler's site appeared, there was a strong pushback on twitter

---

class: center middle

![microfrontends-triangle](images/microfrontends-triangle.png)

???

- Tradeoffs involved
- In order to gain autonomy, we have to sacrifice speed or increase complexity

---

class: center middle

## Factors to consider

---

class: center middle

## Are your teams...

.col-6[
### Vertically divided
]

.col-6[
### Horizontally divided
]

???

- i.e: divided around products or technical layers

---

class: center middle

## Is your priority...

.col-6[
### Fast time to market
]

.col-6[
### High UX consistency
]

???

- i.e: divided around products or technical layers

---

class: center middle

## Are you releasing your application...

.col-6[
### Once every quarter
]

.col-6[
### Once every hour
]

???

- If you are already at a high level of maturity, you might not need this

---

class: transition

# Composition approaches

???

- I mentioned that our microfrotends need to be composed at some point. We want to talk about the alternatives that we have to do so

---

class: center middle

![microfrontends-approaches](images/microfrontends-approaches.png)

???

- This are some of the approaches we will be talking about, which have been included in different ways in different projects of us
- additionally, we'll talk about some other relevant concerns when implementing microfrontends

---

class: transition center middle

# Build time integration

---

class: center middle

## Divide the application into separate npm packages

---

class: center middle

## Deploy them as one entity 

---

class: center

![microfrontends-build-time-integration](images/microfrontends-build-time-integration.png)

---

class: center middle

```json
{
  "name": "@awesome-corp/container",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@awesome-corp/search": "^1.2.3",
    "@awesome-corp/profile": "^7.8.9",
    "@awesome-corp/header": "^0.1.2",
    "@awesome-corp/footer": "^0.2.5"
  }
}
```

---

class: center middle

```html
<BrowserRouter>
  <CssBaseline />
  <Header />

  <Box mt={12}>
    <Container component="main">
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/search" component={Search} />
        <Route path="/profile" component={Profile} />
      </Switch>
    </Container>
  </Box>

  <Footer />
</BrowserRouter>
```

???

- integrate through components
- something as simple as react router can be enough

---

class: center middle

## Managing those packages

---

class: center middle

## Lerna

.bottom-right[
github.com/lerna/lerna
]

???

- monorepo approach is possible
- this is in fact what happened in my last project

---

class: center middle

```plaintext
lerna.json
package.json
packages/
  main/
  header/
  footer/
  microfrontend1/
  microfrontend2/
```

???

- requires teams that collaborate closely together

---

class: center middle

```json
{
  "lerna": "3.15.0",
  "version": "independent",
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true,
  "packages": ["packages/*"]
}
```

???

- `independent` is important as we want to release packages separately

## Server Side Includes

???

- algo Edge Side Includes in Varnish

---

class: center middle

## What is a SSI?


???

- not necessarily a new idea

---

class: center middle

> Server Side Includes (SSI) is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used almost exclusively for the World Wide Web. It is most useful for including the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server, using its #include directive.

---

class: center middle


```html
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>SSI Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Static header</h1>
    <hr/>
    <!--# include file="$PAGE.html" -->
  </body>
</html>
```

---

```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    index index.html;
    ssi on;

    # Decide which HTML fragment to insert based on the URL
    location /browse {
        set $PAGE 'browse';
    }

    location /order {
        set $PAGE 'order';
    }

    location /profile {
        set $PAGE 'profile';
    }
}
```

???

- those are assets that are accessible by our web server

---

class: center middle

## Where is the microfrontend here?

---

class: center middle

![microfrontends-ssi](images/microfrontends-ssi.png)

```html
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">

    </main>
    
    <aside>

# Backend interaction

???

- Composition is not the only concern when working with microfrontends
- if you are dividing your frontend in multiple smaller apps, all of them may need to communicate with a backend

---

class: center middle


## What to avoid

---

class: center middle

![backend-gateway](images/backend-gateway.png)

---

class: center middle

## Backend for frontend

.bottom-right[
samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/
]

---

class: center middle

## A custom backend for a particular client
### Built together with the frontend 
### Owned by the same team

---

class: center middle

![backend-integrations](images/backend-integrations.png)

---

class: center middle

## Microfrontends talk to their own BFF

???

- makes sense to enforce this rule

---

class: center middle

## Avoids coupling

???

- we don't want to lose the benefits we got from switching to this architecture

---

class: center middle

## Chatty applications make your life harder

???

- you cannot avoid communication between microfrontends, but you can reduce it
- can be a sign of a bad domain boundary
